== System Properties
Below, a number of relevant System Properties are listed.


NOTE: All boolean properties below are read using link:https://javadoc.io/static/net.openhft/chronicle-core/2.23ea13/net/openhft/chronicle/core/Jvm.html#getBoolean-java.lang.String-[net.openhft.chronicle.core.Jvm.getBoolean(java.lang.String)], and so are enabled if either `-Dflag` or `-Dflag=true` or `-Dflag=yes`

|===
| Property Key | Default | Description | Java Variable Name (Type)
| chronicle.queue.checkrollcycle | `false` | If enabled, prints a warning message every time a roll cycle file is created | _SHOULD_CHECK_CYCLE_ (boolean)
| chronicle.queue.checkInterrupts | `false` | If enabled, overrides any programmatic setting of checkInterrupt which will result in the tailer throwing an InterruptedException rather than rolling back any ongoing operation upon queue close | _checkInterrupts_ (boolean)
| chronicle.queue.report.linear.scan.latency | `false` | If enabled, - when scan time between two indexes exceeds 100 ms - the scan time will be printed | _REPORT_LINEAR_SCAN_ (boolean)
| chronicle.queue.rollingResourceCache.size | 128 | Determines how many information elements (at most) pertaining to rolled queue files that should be held in memory at any given moment | _CACHE_SIZE_ (int)
| chronicle.queue.warnSlowAppenderMs | 100 | Triggers warning message if an appender takes longer than default time | _WARN_SLOW_APPENDER_MS_ (int)
| chronicle.table.store.timeoutMS | 10000 ms | The maximum time allowed when trying to acquire the exclusive table store lock | timeoutMS (long)
| queue.dont.recover.lock.timeout | `false` | If enabled, throws an exception instead of forcibly unlocking the queue | dontRecoverLockTimeout (boolean)
| queue.ignoreIndexingFailure | `false` | If enabled, an exception is not thrown if the number of entries exceeds the max number for the current rollcycle | _IGNORE_INDEXING_FAILURE_ (boolean)
| PretoucherState.headRoom | 1 << 20 | The minimum headroom the pretoucher allows before expanding the underlying queue file | _HEAD_ROOM_ (int)
| queue.check.index | `false` | If enabled, returns if Chronicle Queue shall assert certain index invariants on various occasions throughout the code. Setting this property to "", "yes" or "true" will enable this feature. Enabling the feature will slow down execution if assertions (-ea) are enabled. | _CHECK_INDEX_ (boolean)
| SingleChronicleQueueExcerpts.earlyAcquireNextCycle | `false` | Used by the pretoucher to acquire the next cycle file, but does NOT do the roll. Setting this property to "yes", "true" or "" results in acquiring the cycle file early | _EARLY_ACQUIRE_NEXT_CYCLE_ (boolean)
| SingleChronicleQueueExcerpts.pretoucherPrerollTimeMs | 2_000L | The pretoucher will create new cycle files this amount of time in advance of them being written to. This moves the Pretoucher's notion of which cycle is "current" into the future by `pretoucherPrerollTimeMs` | _PRETOUCHER_PREROLL_TIME_MS_ (long)
| chronicle.queue.disableFileShrinking | `false` | If enabled, disables shrinking queue files to actual size after a new roll cycle was created | _DISABLE_QUEUE_FILE_SHRINKING_ (boolean)
| chronicle.queue.synchronousFileShrinking | `false` | Setting this property to "yes", "true" or "" results in queue shrinking executing in the same thread and will not be deferred to another thread | _RUN_SYNCHRONOUSLY_ (boolean) #do not use this with Pretoucher
