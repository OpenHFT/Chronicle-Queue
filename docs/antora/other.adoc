=== Compacting logs
Chronicle Queue manages storage by cycle. Adding a `StoreFileListener` will send notifications whenever a file is added, and when it is no longer retained. The message history for a whole day can be moved, compressed, or deleted at once.

NOTE: Unfortunately Windows environments can close the underlying `FileChannel` if an IO operation is interrupted.
