At times, we may not wish to read a queue from start to finish, but are rather interested in a specific set of entries (performing random access reads). This section describes how to navigate a queue using queue indexes. We begin by explaining what information is contained within the index.

NOTE: Queue onfigurations related to indexing is detailed in xref:configuration:index-count.adoc[Index Count] and xref:configuration:index-spacing.adoc[Index Spacing].

[#_index]
== The 8 Byte Index
Every Chronicle Queue index is a byte string of length 8 bytes (`long`). It references a specific data entry as a combination of the cycle (high bits) and sequence number (low bits). Recalling from the chapter on xref:configuration:roll-cycle.adoc[Roll Cycles], a new cycle begins whenever the queue is rolled (a new queue file is created). In turn, the sequence number simply refers to the n:th entry within that queue file (cycle). Both the cycle and sequence number are incremented by 1, and the count begins at 0. 

Different roll-cycles have a difference balance between how many bits are allocated to the message sequence number, and how many of the remaining bits are allocated to the cycle number. In other words, different roll-cycles allow us to trade off the maximum number of cycles, for the maximum number of messages within the cycle. Learn more about this in xref:configuration:roll-cycle.adoc[Roll Cycle]

The convenience method below can help with properly forming an index, assuming the cycle and sequence number is known. See a full example xref:_tail_from_index[here].

[source, Java]
----
long index = queue.rollCycle().toIndex(int cycle, long sequenceNumber); 
----

== End Of Queue Index
You can retrieve the last index written by the appender by calling `lastIndexAppended`. 

[source, Java]
----
long index = appender.lastIndexAppended();
----

It should again be noted that Chronicle Queue appenders are thread-local, meaning only one appender can exist per thread. The  first call to `acquireAppender()` creates the appender, and subsequent calls by the same thread reuses and returns the same instance. However, in a multi-threaded environment there may be more than one appender. In such case `lastIndexAppended()` returns the last index written by the specific appender; not the last index written by _any_ appender. If you wish to find the index of the last record written to the queue, simply call:

[source, Java]
----
queue.lastIndex()
----

This will return the index of the last data present in the queue (or -1 for an empty queue). 

WARNING: If the queue is being written to concurrently itâ€™s possible the value may be an under-estimate, as subsequent entries may have been written even before it was returned.

[#_tail_from_index]
== Tail from Index
As described in the chapter on xref:tailing.adoc[Tailing], the tailer performs sequential reads either forwards or backwards. We can move the tailer's current position using: 

[source, Java]
----
tailer.moveToIndex(long index);
----
This means the next message read will be the one positioned at the given index, and messages will then sequentially by read from this point in the queue unless the tailer is moved again. 

The following example shows how to write 10 messages and then reading the 5th. Note how the index is formed as a combination of the queue and sequence number to properly reference from the current queue. Learn more about how the index is composed in the section xref:#_index[The 8 Byte Index]. 

[source,java]
----
try (final ChronicleQueue queue = singleBuilder("queue").build()) {
    
    final ExcerptAppender appender = queue.acquireAppender();
        
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        appender.writeText("message " + i); 
    }

    int cycle;
    final ExcerptTailer tailer = queue.createTailer();
    try (DocumentContext documentContext = tailer.readingDocument()) {  
        cycle = queue.rollCycle().toCycle(documentContext.index()); <1>
    }

    long index = queue.rollCycle().toIndex(cycle, 5); <2>
    tailer.moveToIndex(index); <3>
    System.out.println(tailer.readText()); <5>

}
----
<1> Reads the current index from the document context to derive the cycle number of the current queue.
<2> Combines the cycle and sequence number to form an index.
<3> Moves the tailer to the target index.

== Count Messages Between Indexes
To count the number of messages between two indexes you can use:

[source, Java]
----
queue.countExcerpts(long fromIndex, long toIndex);
----

NOTE: Avoid calling this method on latency sensitive code. If the indexes are referencing different cycles (different queue files) this method may have to access cold .cq4 files from the file system.
