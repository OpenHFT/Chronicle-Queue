This chapter describes how to perform the most common Chronicle Queue operations. That includes various ways of writing and reading data from a queue. The data could be of various types, including text, numbers, or serialised blobs. Regardless of the data type, it is stored as a series of bytes.

Before moving forward, it should be noted that Chronicle refers to the act of writing as _appending_, and reading as _tailing_. Following from this terminology, writing to a queue is done using an xref:getting-started:glossary.adoc#a[appender] and reading from a queue is done using a xref:getting-started:glossary.adoc#t[tailer].

The details of these concepts are covered in the respective chapters:

* xref:appending.adoc[Appending]
* xref:tailing.adoc[Tailing]

There is also a separate chapter that describes data can be managed using a read/write proxies.

* xref:read-write-proxies.adoc[Read/write proxies]
