Data is appended (written) to the end of a Chronicle Queue using an _appender_.Messages are always written in the order the appender wrote them.You can have multiple appenders writing messages to the same queue, in such case messages by different appenders are interleaved.

An appender is acquired from the queue instance as follows:

[source,Java]
----
try (ChronicleQueue queue = ChronicleQueue.singleBuilder("trades").build()) { 
   final ExcerptAppender appender = queue.acquireAppender(); 
}
----

A simple text message can then be written using the method `writeText(CharSequence text)`.

[source, Java]
----
String message = "Hello World!";
appender.writeText(message);
----

There are however various ways of appending data, ranging from high-level abstractions such as `writeText` and xref:queue-operations:read-write-proxies.adoc#_methodwriter[write proxies] down to a low-level API, or even writing directly to raw memory.These alternatives are presented in more detail in the following sections.

== Low-level API  
== Writing Text 
The high-level methods such as `writeText()` are convenience methods on directly calling `appender.writingDocument()`, but both approaches essentially achieve the same thing.The implementation of `writeText(CharSequence text)` looks like this:

[source,Java]
----
void writeText(CharSequence text) {
    try (DocumentContext dc = writingDocument()) {
        dc.wire().bytes().append8bit(text);
    }
}
----

As shown above, the document context can be used to append data directly:

[source,Java]
----
try (final DocumentContext dc = appender.writingDocument()) {
      dc.wire().write().text(“Your text data“);
}
----

The length of the data is written to the header when the try-with-resources block reaches _close_.You can also use the `DocumentContext` to find out the index that the data has just been assigned (see below).The index can later be used to move-to/look up this excerpt.

[source,Java]
----
try (final DocumentContext dc = appender.writingDocument()) {
    dc.wire().write().text(“your text data“);
    System.out.println("your data was store to index="+ dc.index());
}
----

NOTE: Each Chronicle Queue excerpt has a unique index.

You can also write a text message with an associated label

[source, Java]
----
appender.writeDocument(wire -> wire.write("FirstName").text("Rob"));
appender.writeDocument(wire -> wire.write("LastName").text("Rob"));
----


=== Self-describing Message
You also have the option to write a "self-describing message". Such messages can support schema changes. They are also easier to understand when debugging or diagnosing problems.

[source,Java]
----
appender.writeDocument(w -> w.write("trade").marshallable(
        m -> m.write("timestamp").dateTime(now)
                .write("symbol").text("EURUSD")
                .write("price").float64(1.1101)
                .write("quantity").float64(15e6)
                .write("side").object(Side.class, Side.Sell)
                .write("trader").text("peter")));
----

=== Writing an Object 
You also have the option to append an object to the queue. In such case, we recommend that the class implements `net.openhft.chronicle.wire.Marshallable` and overrides the `toString` method to allow for more efficient serialisation. See the example below:

[source,Java]
----
    static class Person implements Marshallable {
        String name;
        int age;

        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return Marshallable.$toString(this);
        }
    }
----

An instance of `Person` can be then be written with `appender.writeDocument()` as follows:

[source, java]
----
SingleChronicleQueue queue = SingleChronicleQueueBuilder.builder().path(Files
    .createTempDirectory("queue").toFile()).build();
ExcerptAppender appender = queue.acquireAppender();
        
Person person = new Person();
person.name = "Rob";
person.age = 40;

appender.writeDocument(person);
----

NOTE: Learn how to read the object from the queue in xref:tailing.adoc#_reading_an_object[Reading an Object].

== Writing Raw Data
If you want more control over how objects are serialised you have the option to append "raw data" to the queue.

=== Self Describing 
You can write "raw data" which is self-describing. The types will always be correct; position is the only indication as to the meaning of those values.

[source,Java]
----
appender.writeDocument(w -> w
        .getValueOut().int32(0x123456)
        .getValueOut().int64(0x999000999000L)
        .getValueOut().text("Hello World"));
----

=== Not Self-describing 
You can write "raw data" which is not self-describing. Your reader must know what this data means, and the types that were used.

[source,Java]
----
appender.writeBytes(b -> b
        .writeByte((byte) 0x12)
        .writeInt(0x345678)
        .writeLong(0x999000999000L)
        .writeUtf8("Hello World"));
----

== Writing to Raw Memory 
At the lowest abstraction level you get an address to raw memory where you can write whatever you want.

[source,Java]
----
// Unsafe low level
appender.writeBytes(b -> {
    long address = b.address(b.writePosition());
    Unsafe unsafe = UnsafeMemory.UNSAFE;
    unsafe.putByte(address, (byte) 0x12);
    address += 1;
    unsafe.putInt(address, 0x345678);
    address += 4;
    unsafe.putLong(address, 0x999000999000L);
    address += 8;
    byte[] bytes = "Hello World".getBytes(StandardCharsets.ISO_8859_1);
    unsafe.copyMemory(bytes, Jvm.arrayByteBaseOffset(), null, address, bytes.length);
    b.writeSkip(1 + 4 + 8 + bytes.length);
});
