It's possible to configure how Chronicle Queue will store the data by explicitly setting the `WireType`:

For example:

[source, java]
----
SingleChronicleQueue queue = ChronicleQueue.singleBuilder("rollCycleTest")
    .wireType(RollCycles.DAILY)
    .build();
----

NOTE: The default `WireType` is `BINARY_LIGHT`.

[WARNING]
.Supported wire types
====
Although it's possible to explicitly provide `WireType` when creating a builder, it is discouraged as not all wire types are supported by Chronicle Queue yet.

In particular, the following wire types are not supported:

* `TEXT` (and essentially all based on text, including JSON and CSV)

* `RAW`

* `READ_ANY`
