//== Downloading and Running Sample Programs
//
//If you're running Windows, you will need to install the `git` client and `open-ssh` Cygwin, https://cygwin.com/install.html[here],
//with a guide showing installation and packages http://www.mcclean-cooper.com/valentino/cygwin_install/[here].
//This allows you to install Linux packages that aren't already on Windows.
//
//When this asks you which packages you want to install, search for and add `git`. This is under `Development` and you need to click `skip` so it says to `install`.
//
