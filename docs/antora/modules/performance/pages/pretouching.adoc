During the write process, there is significant write-speed variation as the process has to find new memory to write to. This can be mitigated by _pre-touching_ storage resources for the current queue to allow appenders to exhibit more predictable latencies.

[NOTE]
.Pre-touching
====
Pre-touching involves accessing pages of files/memory that are likely accessed in a
near future and may also involve accessing/acquiring future cycle files.
====

There are two ways to perform pre-touching, outlined below:

* **Triggering pre-touches manually** - Perform pre-touching once for the current appender using `ExcerptAppender.pretouch()`
* **Automatically pre-touching using Chronicle's preloader ★** - The preloader automatically pre-touches segments at a given time interval _(Enterprise feature)_.

== Pre-touching once
A single pre-touching operation can be performed by the appender by calling `pretouch()` as follows:

[source, java]
----
queue.acquireAppender().pretouch();
----

IMPORTANT: The pre-toucher must be invoked from the same thread that created the appender, as the call to `pretouch()` is not thread safe.

Albeit not required, it is suggested to perform pre-touching in a background thread (not the main business thread) to avoid contention. The below example spins up a thread that performs pre-touching every second.

[source, java]
----
newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor().scheduleAtFixedRate(
    () -> queue.acquireAppender().pretouch(), #<1>
    0, #<2>
    1, #<3>
    TimeUnit.SECONDS #<4>
);
----
<1> The task to execute
<2> The time to delay first execution
<3> The period between successive executions
<4> The time unit of the `initialDelay` and period parameters

== Automatic pre-touching ★
The easiest way to configure periodical pre-touching is by using Chronicle's out-of-process preloader. It can be activated in the Chronicle Queue Builder as follows:

[source, java]
----
ChronicleQueue queue = ChronicleQueue.singleBuilder(".")
    .enablePreloader(1000) #<1>
    .build();
----
<1> Interval in milliseconds to invoke the preloader

IMPORTANT: The preloader is part of Chronicle Queue Enterprise.

=== Benchmarks
The graph below shows the comparative speeds between using, and not using the preloader. It is clear that the preloader both significantly improves the average write-speed and decreases outliers.

NOTE: Normally, the preloader would be run in a background thread, but for the purposes of the performance test shown above it was run in the same thread, but not timed.
