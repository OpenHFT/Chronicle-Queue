In Chronicle Queue, the time at which queues are rolled over is based on the UTC time; Chronicle Queue uses `System.currentTimeMillis()`. The Timezone Rollover Enterprise feature extends Chronicle Queue's ability to specify the time and periodicity of queue rollovers, to take account of the user's location timezone, rather than UTC.
