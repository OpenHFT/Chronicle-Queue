/**
 * <em>Chronicle</em> (in a generic sense) is a Java project focused on
 * building a persisted low latency messaging framework for high performance
 * and critical applications.
 *
 * <p> Using non-heap storage options <em>Chronicle</em> provides a processing
 * environment where applications does not suffer from <em>GarbageCollection</em>.
 * <em>GarbageCollection</em> (GC) may slow down your critical operations non-deterministically
 * at any time.. In order to avoid non-determinism and escape from GC delays
 * off-heap memory solutions are addressed. The main idea is to manage your
 * memory manually so does not suffer from GC. Chronicle behaves like a
 * management interface over off-heap memory so you can build your own solutions over it.
 *
 * <p> </p><em>Chronicle</em> uses RandomAccessFiles while managing memory and this choice
 * brings lots of possibility. Random access files permit non-sequential,
 * or random, access to a file's contents. To access a file randomly, you
 * open the file, seek a particular location, and read from or write to
 * that file. RandomAccessFiles can be seen as "large" C-type byte arrays
 * that you can access any random index "directly" using pointers. File
 * portions can be used as ByteBuffers if the portion is mapped into memory.
 *
 * <p>{@link net.openhft.chronicle.Chronicle} (now in the specific sense) is the
 * main interface for management and can be seen as the "Collection class" of the
 * <em>Chronicle</em> environment. You will reserve a portion of memory and then
 * put/fetch/update records using the {@link net.openhft.chronicle.Chronicle} interface.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@link net.openhft.chronicle.Excerpt} is the main data container in a
 * {@link net.openhft.chronicle.Chronicle}, each Chronicle is composed of Excerpts.
 * Putting data to a chronicle means starting a new Excerpt, writing data into it and finishing
 * the Excerpt at the end.</p>
 *
 * <p>While {@link net.openhft.chronicle.Excerpt} is a generic purpose container allowing
 * for remote access, it also has more specialized counterparts for sequential operations.
 * See {@link net.openhft.chronicle.ExcerptTailer} and {@link net.openhft.chronicle.ExcerptAppender}</p>
